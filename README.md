# Application of Monte Carlo Simulation in Financial Forecasting 
Business management would often like to make predictions about the future performance of their businesses in terms of different measures such as revenues, costs and profits etc. The finance team of the firm would often be given the task to build financial models and forecast the results under different scenarios. The common approach would be to come up with three potential scenarios, namely the best scenario, the normal scenario and the worst scenario, by varying the underlying assumptions in the financial model. The purpose of the exercise is to provide the management with a better overview of how the business would perform under different market environments.

Nevertheless, the drawback of this type of financial model is that we do not know how likely each scenario would happen. In other words, no probability is assigned to these scenarios. A probabilistic approach in modelling the business performance might provide more insight and help management make better decisions.

In <a href="https://medium.com/@tsoiyingkit/application-of-monte-carlo-simulation-in-financial-forecasting-1ddb231080f9">this article</a>, I discuss the approach of using Monte Carlo Simulation in business performance analysis, and how to implement in Python.
